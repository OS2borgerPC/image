# settings on a OS2borgerPC machine.
#
# Instructions:
#    - Configure the screensaver as you want it on an existing machine
#    - Run this script and specify your .xscreensaver file as input parameter
#    - The audience user must log out and log in again for your changes to take
#      effect.


# Check input.
