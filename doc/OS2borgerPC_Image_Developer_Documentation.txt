OS2borgerPC Image Developer Documentation
===================================

The OS2borgerPC image is created by a number of scripts placed in
image/scripts in combination with the "shadow" file system in the
overwrites directory located in image/overrides.

The overwrites/ directory is copied to / on the target system. This
document will describe the different parts of the scripts and overwrite
directories and explain which functions they fulfil.  OS2borgerPC installation
Setup

The main installation script is image/scripts/os2borgerpc_setup.sh. This
script will take a fresh Ubuntu 12.04 or 14.04 installation and convert 
it to a OS2borgerPC system.

To do this, it will take the following steps:

    Invoke the script do_overwrite.sh. At present, do_overwrite installs
    our gnome-control-center hack or for Ubuntu 14.04 unity-control-center
    hack (so audience users are unable to access system settings) and then 
    performs the overwrite as indicated by the following pseudocode:

    DESTINATION='/'
    cp -r ../overwrites/* $DESTINATION

    Invoke the script install_dependencies.sh. This script will install
    the additional software which we need to install on the image as
    part of our contractual obligation/the customer's wishes. The
    additional packages are listed in a separate file called
    DEPENDENCIES. The install_dependencies script will also upgrade (but
    not dist-upgrade) the system. It will also remove the packages which
    must be removed from a OS2borgerPC system - at present, only deja-dup.
    Create a default user with user id user, full name "Publikum",
    ensure it has no sudo rights and add it to the nopasswdlogin group.

Finalize

Once the os2borgerpc_setup script has been called and has executed
succesfully, the system is a working OS2borgerPC system. The only thing it
needs is that part of the setup which can only be done locally, be it
for legal or practical reasons. In order to do this, the finalize.sh
script is called. This script is to be called as the very last thing
after the system is fully customized and before the image is cloned and
inserted into a CloneZilla image.

The finalize.sh script will do the following:

    Copy the os2borgerpc-postinstall.desktop file from scripts to
    /etc/xdg/autostart. This will forcibly invoke the OS2borgerPC postinstall
    script next time the system is booted

    Copy the os2borgerpc-postinstall.sh file from scripts to
    /usr/share/os2borgerpc/bin. This is the script invoked by the autostarting
    desktop file

    Modify /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf to make the sudo user (by
    convention called superuser) log in automatically upon the nex boot.
    This will not work if this user's home directory is encrypted, and
    in that case the users setting up each system must log in as the
    super user upon first login.

Postinstall

As described above, postinstall is done by the os2borgerpc-postinstall.sh
script. At present, this script will perform the following steps:

    Set up printers, invoking the system-config-printer command

    Cleanup - the postinstall script and icon is removed, and the 
    original /etc/lightdm/lighdm.conf is reinstated.

If the customers wish to connect to Landscape or (as they will!) our
own, upcoming admin system, this should be done in this script.  The
overwrites directory

As stated above, this directory contains a "shadow" file system which
will be copied onto the target system's root, overwriting existing
files. At present, the contents of the overwrites directory are as
follows: /usr

    /usr/bin contains our "patched" gnome-control-center which will
    prevent users called user from accessing system settings. Note: This
    should probably be done by group membership and permissions rather
    than a hard coded user name.

    /usr/local/bin contains a Landscape connection script and a file
    called Logout.desktop which is used to log out from the Internet in
    the libraries in Aarhus. Both are deprecated, and the location
    /usr/local/bin will no longer be used by OS2borgerPC. Instead, all OS2borgerPC
    related scripts should be placed in /usr/share/os2borgerpc/bin.

    /usr/share/os2borgerpc contains custom icons (at present only one), custom
    printer installation software and scripts. At present, only the
    user_cleanup.sh bash script is actually used. /usr/share/os2borgerpc/bin
    is to be the home of all custom OS2borgerPC scripts, and /usr/share/os2borgerpc/
    is generally the home of the OS2borgerPC installation.

/home

overwrites/home contains the hidden directory .skjult, which is used as
a template for the audience user's home directory. All customization of
the user's wallpaper, login options, X settings, etc. should be done
here. After each logout or reboot the user's home directory is wiped and
replaced with the contents of .skjult.

/etc

/etc is currently only used to control login and user cleanup.

User login is controlled by /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf. This file has a
number of settings that control the X session. This file could, e.g.,
look as follows:

[SeatDefaults]
greeter-session=unity-greeter
user-session=ubuntu-2d
session-cleanup-script=/usr/share/os2borgerpc/bin/user-cleanup.bash
allow-guest=false
autologin-user-timeout=0
autologin-user=user

This specifies that:

    ubuntu-2d, i.e., no 3D effects, is used for the user interface
    The user cleanup script is called on each logout
    Guest login is not allowed
    The audience user user will be automatically logged in.

If the customer wishes to change any of this so that e.g. user is
required to supply a password, this file is where such changes should be
made.

The etc/ directory also contains an rc.local file which is executed each
time the system is booted. At present, this file calls the
user_cleanup.bash script. This is because the LighDM session cleanup
will NOT work with shutdown and reboot.
