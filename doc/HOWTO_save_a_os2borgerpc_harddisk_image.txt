Guide to saving an image of a hard disk prepared for OS2borgerPC installation

To save a hard disk image for use in creating an OS2borgerPC installation disk,
download a Clonezilla iso from http://clonezilla.org/ and boot it on the
machine with the hard disk.
Then follow the guide at

https://clonezilla.org/show-live-doc-content.php?topic=clonezilla-live/doc/01_Save_disk_image

but choose to save a single partition instead of the whole disk. The partition
you want to save is the main partition you installed Ubuntu on and is probably
called sda1.

Once the disk image has been saved, it can be used to create an installation
disk. See the files HOWTOBuild_BibOS_CD_from_clonezilla_image.txt and
How-to-build-an-OS2borgerPC-installation-USB-stick-from-an-existing-Clonezilla-image.md
in this directory for more information.
