This code contains a specialized Ubuntu distribution for audience PCs in

The OS2borgerPC system is a specialized version of Ubuntu which contains one
preinstalled audience user (called "user", full name "Borger") and one
sudo-enabled user, by convention called "superuser".

The audience user's home directory is always deleted after each logout
to ensure audience user's privacy. A number of other customizations are
performed.

The system is installed using CloneZilla. The procedure is to prepare an
installation on a physical or virtual computer, clone that system's hard
disk with CloneZilla and create a custome CloneZilla CD which is used as
the install CD (or USB, or DVD).

See the documentation in doc/ for more details.

A couple of HOWTOs:

Creating a new OS2borgerPC image from scratch
=======================================

    Start installing a vanilla Ubuntu system - Ubuntu 16.04 in the
    present example. Install on a virtual or physical machine

    Select the correct target language for installation - Danish if
    your users want to work in Danish.

    Create the initial user as Superuser - specify OS2borgerPC as host name.
    This is by convention, the initial user (sudo user) and host name can
    be whatever you want

    Enter a system/superuser password - IMPORTANT: Remember this

    Think about whether to select the option to encrypt the superuser's
    $HOME directory (current recommendation: Do NOT do this)

    Let the installation run its course - this may take some time

    Reboot the computer when prompted and log in with the user name and
    password you specified

    In a terminal,
    Download the installation script:
    * wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OS2borgerPC/image/master/image/scripts/os2borgerpc_installation.sh
    Make the downloaded script executable:
    * chmod +x os2borgerpc_installation.sh
    Execute the script:
    * ./os2borgerpc_installation.sh

After the system has rebooted, the system is ready for cloning and inclusion
in a CloneZilla image.

Boot up the system with a CloneZilla live CD and clone an image, e.g.
to your own /home/partimag using SSHFS.
